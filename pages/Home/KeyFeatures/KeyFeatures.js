      <h2>Pomodoro Pilot: Efficient Time Management for Productivity</h2>
      <p>
        Pomodoro Pilot is a powerful web application designed to enhance your productivity through the proven Pomodoro Technique. This technique, developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s, revolves around focused work sessions followed by short breaks, resulting in improved concentration and efficiency.

      <h3>What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h3>
      <p>
        The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that encourages individuals to break their work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, known as &quot;Pomodoros.&quot; After each Pomodoro, take a short break. After completing a set of Pomodoros, take a longer break. This structured approach aims to minimize burnout, maintain focus, and increase overall productivity.
