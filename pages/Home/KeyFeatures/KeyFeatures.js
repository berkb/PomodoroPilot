      <h2>Pomodoro Pilot: Elevate Your Productivity with Enhanced Features</h2>
      <p>
        Pomodoro Pilot is a feature-rich web application designed to supercharge your productivity using the renowned Pomodoro Technique.

      <h3>Understanding the Pomodoro Technique:</h3>
      <p>
        The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that advocates breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes long, known as &quot;Pomodoros.&quot; After each Pomodoro, take a short break. Following a set of Pomodoros, take a longer break. This structured approach minimizes burnout, fosters focus, and boosts overall productivity.
